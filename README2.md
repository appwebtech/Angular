Angular
=========

Angular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications. 

Why Angular? 

I have been developing for quite a while and after years of freelancing, I decided to get certified. In many cases clients never ask for credentials, they just want to see your portfoglio and feedback from former clients. But something happened. One Friday evening we had an hackathon with other developers in other parts of the world, building web apps and stuff. 

Some coders made amazing apps in like four hours and by 04:00 am, I was still testing my code. Then the idea of Ruby on Rails struck because that was the platform they were using. I had ignored the framework for a while but after trying it, it really cut down my development time. 

I enrolled in Johns Hopkins University, in the Whitting School of Engineering, CS department. And thats how I happen to be doing AngularJS as part of the specialisation certification offered by the Uni via Coursera. 

Benefits of Using AngularJS
1. Dependency Injection
2. Two Way Data-Binding
3. Testing 
4. MVC
5. Controlling DOM elements using Directives, Filters etc
