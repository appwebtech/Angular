What is a module in AngularJS
A module is a container for different parts of your application i.e controllers, services, directives, filters, etc.

What is a controller in angular
In angular a controller is a JavaScript function. The job of the controller is to build a model for the view to display. The model is the data. In a real world application, the controller may call into a service to retrieve data from the database.

What is $scope
$scope is a parameter that is passed to the controller function by angular framework. We attach the model to the $scope object, which will then be available in the view. Within the view, we can retrieve the data from the scope object and display.


- First create the module.
- Then crerate the controller.
- Then register the controller with the module using controller function. 
- Call the $scope object to the controller.
